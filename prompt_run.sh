#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This is a simple script that can
# generate a prompt when ssh-ing to a server
#
# Add:
# 	RequestTTY yes
#	RemoteCommand /path/to/file/on/remote/server/prompt_run.sh; exec tcsh  -l
#
# To the ~/.ssh/config entry of the host you're connecting to
#
# RequestTTY yes will always request a TTY when standard input is a TTY
# exec tcsh -l can be changed to work for whichever shell you're using on the server
